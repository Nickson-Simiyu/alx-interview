UTF-8 encoding.

The function takes a data set as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the data set is a valid UTF-8 encoding.

The function works by iterating over the data set and checking each byte to see if it is a valid start byte, continuation byte, or end byte. If any byte is not a valid byte, the function returns False.

If all bytes are valid, the function checks the number of bytes in the current character. If the number of bytes is not valid, the function returns False.

If all bytes are valid and the number of bytes is valid, the function returns True.

Here is an example of how to use the function:

```
data = [0b11000000, 0b10100000, 0b10100000, 0b10100000]

print(validUTF8(data))
# True
```

The data set in this example is a valid UTF-8 encoding because it contains four bytes, which is the correct number of bytes for a 4-byte character. All four bytes are also valid start bytes, continuation bytes, or end bytes.

Here is an example of an invalid UTF-8 encoding:

```
data = [0b11000000, 0b10100000, 0b10100000, 0b10100000, 0b10100000]

print(validUTF8(data))
# False
```

The data set in this example is an invalid UTF-8 encoding because it contains five bytes, which is not the correct number of bytes for a 4-byte character. The fifth byte is also not a valid continuation byte.
